# Kafah and Daniel's Wedding Website

After researching all kinds of wedding websites to find the best option for my cousin Kafah and, her future husband, Daniel's wedding, it seemed to make more sense to build one from scratch.

The application allows invitees to view information about the wedding, as well as submit their RSVPs.

The Response model has attributes that include attendance, number of attendees, food allergies, song requests, as well as messages for the couple.

Kafah and Daniel will be able to download all RSVP submissions to a CSV file.

* This wedding website application is built with Ruby 5.0.1 and uses the Devise gem in order to allow administrative capacities.
